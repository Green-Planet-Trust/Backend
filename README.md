# Backend
This functions as the API connecting our project

# What I did to set up my enviornment 
0. Set up Homebrew 
1. brew install python
2. sudo easy_install pip
3. sudo pip install pipenv
    1. sudo -H pip install -U pipenv
4. pipenv install
5. pipenv run python server.py

## NOTE
- The config files are stored in a config file kept offline since it has private keys, this is needed to run so just ask
- Also I removed a Python dependency in the Pipfile since it was not happy my version of python was ahead of the listed version (at least I hope so)
